# SQL-Project-Animal-Shelter
This is the repository containing my Data Analysis Project in SQL. 

I investigated data from the Austin Animal Center to dive deep into the intakes and outakes of the animal shelter. 

Questions I answered:
- What was the Intake Condition of animals that were adopted out?
- What are the most popular coat colors in adopted animals?
- What type of animals were most frequently adopted? 

Visualization for this project was created in Tableau.
